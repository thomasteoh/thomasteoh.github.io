The first nematode section has now been uploaded, and covers the trichostrongyles (of mostly ruminants. As per normal, they can be accessed via the [Resources]({{ site.baseurl }}resources) section! 

As these are long specimens, pictures of the entire organism are difficult to capture with the equipment I currently have access to. The focus will be on capturing anatomical structures useful for species identification.
