Allowing visitors to share pages to social media is a good way of disseminating information and driving traffic to your website. The issue I have previously had with it has been that the recommended methods, embedded buttons, relied on adding a script to each of your pages, which had the potential to slow down page loading times or track your usage across different websites. HTML hyperlinks, on the other hand, are universally supported and provide a pretty easy to use way for visitors to directly create a post.

The backend of Github pages uses jekyll, which conveniently stores useful information such as the address of each post. From there, it is just a matter of working out the format of the links for the respective social media sites that you'd like to use.

The process of getting this set up involves some tinkering with the software of your device, and can lead to loss of data or potentially rendering it unusable. As always, caution is advised; ensure your data (files, photos, videos) is safely stored outside of the device you're going to be playing with. It might be a good idea to only try this process on a spare device such as an old phone or tablet.
