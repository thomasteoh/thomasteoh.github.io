The Fleas and Lice section under [Resources]({{ site.baseurl }}resources) has been uploaded! In it, there will be microscopy of the species of parasite that are of relevance to veterinary domestic animal health in Australia. This will continue to be a work in progress, as I collect more pictures and add information.
