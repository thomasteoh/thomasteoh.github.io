With the start of the colder weather in Victoria as winter approaches, hearty fare to warm the bones is always welcome. As we were passing through Richmond, it made much sense to revisit one of our favourite Vietnamese restaurants, Pho Hung Vuong 2.

## The restaurant

Pho Hung Vuong 2 is situated along Victoria Street in Richmond, with easy access to trams (24, 42, 109) and close to North Richmond train station. Parking is also reasonably easily found as well, whether it be along the street or within a carpark (The Hive shopping complex has 1 hour free parking, and is just across the road).

Recently refurbished, the restaurant is clean and inviting. Chairs and tables have been packed onto the dining floor, and it can get a bit cramped getting in an out when it gets busy. The dining experience feels efficient, with no fuss or nonsense. As you enter, staff will show you or indicate a table where you can sit, where you'll find cutlery, sauces, tissues and tea tucked to the side on a tray. Menus in English and Vietnamese are mounted as signs on the walls. 

The selection available is comparable to other Vietnamese restaurants specialising in this type of cuisine, variations on Phở (rice noodle soup), rice, vermicelli (rice-noodle salads), and bún (bread) dishes. While the menu may look daunting to the uninitiated, choosing what you want is pretty straightforward; select what type of dish you want (and what size), and then choose what you want in it. 

## Food

I ended up choosing to go with a Phở, a rice noodle soup commonly served with slices of rare beef in a stocky meat soup. Serving sizes are very generous, and prices are affordable (~$10 for a main).

Various cuts of meat are served in the Combination Beef Phở, including sliced rare beef, beef balls, cartilage, beef sausage and tripe (usually reticulum or omasum). These introduce different textural elements to the dish, from the tender meat of the slices beef that cooks within the hot soup, to the soft and smooth articulating cartilage and chewy, less commonly seen (in Australia) ruminant stomach wall. 

The soup is another distinctive element, smooth, sweet and salty with a very strong beef fragrance, much akin to beef stock with the addition of herbs. It is flavourful and delicious, not always the case at all other restaurants. You are provided with condiments, and other toppings such as bean sprouts, mint, chilli and lemon to modify it to your tastes, but I find that it is nice enough without needing to add anything else. 

Within the soup, you'll also find rice noodle, in the shape of linguine but much softer than semolina pasta. Like their constituent ingredient, rice, they don't have much of an inherent taste; rather, they take up the soup's flavour as they steep. 

Overall, a decidedly simple yet fulfilling experience, definitely something to try especially on days of inclement weather.
