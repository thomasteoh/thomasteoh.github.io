Ticks are now uploaded into the  [Resources]({{ site.baseurl }}resources) section! There are a whole bunch of them today, with multiple views (mostly of dorsum and ventra). Unfortunately, there were some damaged ones this week, which is a bit out of my control. The specimens are large and dessicate easily, which means that they damage easily. Now that they've been in use for teaching for a number of years now, it was inevitable that there is some obvious damage on some of the rarer specimens in the collection. Nevertheless, if you're looking for anatomy or pictures of these species, most are still pretty good!
