After an eventful evening of trying to fix a light (saga ongoing), we decided to eat out in Footscray. Roti Road was a pretty safe choice; I'd previously been to this venue with my colleagues and enjoyed ourselves. Today, I had the chance to go back and try the nasi lemak, quite possibly one of the most quintissentially Malaysian dishes.

## The restaurant

Roti Road is located on the main street in Footscray, a short walk down Barkly street from Footscray train station and the markets. It bills itself as "Malaysian Chinese" cuisine, even though it's namesake, Roti, has origins in the Indian subcontinent, and they don't serve a number of popular nyonya dishes like otak otak and and asam laksa. Instead, they offer a sizeable menu that focuses on a few items within each category, and even seem to open for yum cha during the daytime. Its a good approach, as they can focus on delivering a good product along with catering to local tastes (Melbournians really love dumpling-like food items).

We went on a Thursday night, and while the restaurant was bustling with activity, we were offered a table immediately. Internal furnishings looked new/recently refurbished and well thought out; despite being in the midst of the diners, we didn't feel crowded. Theres a bar and apparantly you can watch the chefs prepare your roti, although we didn't see for ourselves. 

Another good aspect was the service. Staff were polite, efficient, and fast. There were no problems with the orders we placed, and the first dishes to come out arrived before 10 minutes had elapsed from ordering. Prices were also reasonable. 

## Food

Given the name of the restaurant, it was imperative that we try the <b>roti canai</b>. Its a type of flatbread thats made by stretching and spinning it around, making it deliciously light and fluffy. Alongside this, a selection of curry is usually served.

Serving sizes were generous, and proportions of bread and curry are good. To eat, you ideally use your hands to tear off a chunk of roti to dip in the curry. Its definitely an experience to try, and is similar to eating other Indian breads, like naan or chapati. A good thing about this dish is that it works well as a shared appetiser, as long as everyone's hands are clean and nobody double dips >:(

My main was, of course, the nasi lemak. Theres a little bit of choice to be had here in which curry you'd like to have with it. Very commonly, its eaten with beef rendang, curry chicken or a combination of the both. The arrangement I went with in the end was the beef rendang variant.

One of the main reasons why I've liked nasi lemak, growing up, was the variety of sides included in the one dish. Roti Road's offering has the following (clockwise): sambal (a chilli-based sauce) prawns, sambal egg, cucumbers, peanuts, ikan bilis (dried anchovies), and my selection of curry (beef rendang). This is well complimented by the coconut rice, the richness of the coconut milk/cream likely giving the "lemak" quality to the nasi (rice). 

One curious quality about the rice that I noted was that it seemed like salt was sprinkled over the top of it. Its the first time I've tried it like this, and can't help wondering if it was perhaps done by accident. 

It should be noted that some of the curries and sauces can be quite spicy, but Roti Road's rendition was very much on the milder side, which should open it up to suiting a wider audience. A good trick to try is having something milk- or cream-based afterwards if you're not coping so well. Its also a good excuse to order dessert.

Roti pisang to share (pisang being banana in bahasa) was, as with above, very well made, with the heavy sweetness of the banana offset by the ice cream. 

Overall we enjoyed our dinner at Roti Road, and will likely be back the next time we're in the area.
