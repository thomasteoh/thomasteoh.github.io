One of the great things about Melbourne is the wonderful variety of international cuisines found within different pockets of the city. Gyoza Douraku, self labelled as a Japanese gyoza bar, is one such establishment that combines two favourites amongst Melbourne folk: international alcohols and gyoza (Japanese dumplings).

## The restaurant

Gyoza Douraku is located on the east side of the city, within an easy walk from the main shopping areas around Bourke Street mall. As a result of this, much of the after-work and dinnertime bustle is left behind at Swanston Street. Its definitely something to appreciate, and is especially nice if you're looking for a relatively quiet part of the city to meet friends or colleagues, or have a romantic night out.

Internally, the restaurant has a Japanese-esq styling with a subtly lit dining area split amongst multiple floors. Seating space is ample within the booths, although at the bar it appeared to be a little more cramped (which may or may not be preferral depending on individual preference on atmostphere). If you're planning on ordering lots of food, having a table is definitely an advantage though, as the multitude of dishes do end up taking up plenty of space. 

Staff are present, but appear very busy. Throughout dinner, they were mostly polite but curt, somewhat different to our previous experiences at other Japanese restaurants. Additionally, they didn't appear to have many menus on hand, our table having to wait for other diners to finish perusing and ordering before receiving a set. That being said, our food and drinks came out quickly, and we had no particular issues with it in general. Perhaps they were busy on the day we had dinner. 

## Food

Gyoza Douraku is a Isakaya-style bar, where patrons can order from a selection of dishes to accompany their drink, much akin to Spanish tapas. The menu is sizeable and varied, and dishes seemed to be at a standard price of $6.50 (at time of writing).

You're encouraged to make your own dipping sauce to your own tastes, and are provided with garlic, vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil and chilli oil to do so. The interactivity adds a nice personalised aspect to the experience, and it was fun to do and talk about in a group.

As the food came in small morsels to share, we had the opportunity to order a bunch of different things. Some of the items we ordered included the tuna tataki, mini burgers, and gyoza specials. All were well prepared and very tasty.

Tuna tataki, slices of uncooked tuna briefly seared and prepared with a light vinegar based sauce, was nice to start with. Serving size could have been a bit larger.

Two orders of mini burgers, one with lobster and the other with crab, went down well, although were a little more difficult to share amongst more than 2 people.

The pork and garlic gyoza were very well made. The skin was thin and delicate, yet easy to pick up with chopsticks without disintegrating. The slight crispiness from the pan sear at the bottom also added texture. Inside, the filling was moist and succulent, with a small amount of meaty broth. Dipped in vinegar and garlic, the flavours pick up a slight acidity and fragrance that is quite pleasing to the palate. 

Overall we did enjoy the food here, and it would definitely be somewhere to consider for an informal drink and dinner.
