Situated in the vicinity of the research precinct bordering Parkville and North Melbourne, and within close proximity to both the Royal Melbourne Hospital and Royal Children's Hospital is an outwardly unassuming cafe catering to university staff, students, parents and local lab denizens. As one of a few cafes within easy walking distance, Avist Cafe always appears to be quite popular, and noticeably busy in the middle of the day.

## The restaurant

Clean and modern on the inside, the layout is similar to other cafes. At front is a counter with hot foods, baked goods and sandwich fillings. A chalkboard is mounted above this area, and lists drinks, other food items and specials. Options to dine in or take away are both available, and service seems quick and efficient. 

## Food

On this occasion, I went with a vegie burger with a side of Greek salad to eat in, one of the listed items under the daily specials.

Portions are decent, and good value especially considering prices at other restaurants in the area. It arrived within a reasonable timeframe, although somewhat behind orders from the ready-to-go hot counter, which is to be expected. 

Its definitely nice that the burger was prepared upon order, and showed in the very nice combination of lightly toasted bun, crisp salad and vegie pattie. The Greek salad was lightly dressed and tasty; would have loved to have slightly more feta cheese in it. Overall I found the meal pleasant and fulfilling.
