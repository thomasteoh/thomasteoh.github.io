Some sad news today. Violet, my partner's Cavalier King Charles, passed away in Hong Kong. She has had some long term heart difficulties spanning over half a decade, which worsened suddenly last night and this morning.

<!--break-->

Cavalier King Charles Spaniels are well known to be very affectionate, and Violet was no exception. She loved and was loved in return by her whole family. Dogs of her breed are predisposed to certain genetically inherited diseases, including mitral valve insufficiency and syringomyelia. 

Violet had mitral valve insufficiency, affecting the mitral valve of her heart. This disease causes regurgitation during systole, where blood leaks back into the left atrium. As the blood backs up, oedema develops in the pulmonary parenchyma. She had been slowing down over the years, and becoming intolerant of exercise. Her sudden deterioration could have come about from a number of different things, one of which perhaps being a rupture of cordae tendinae; it is difficult to say without a necropsy.

Violet will be remembered as a sweet, very intelligent girl. She had a tendancy to snore (loudly), waking up those around her. She also knew how to get away with things, using her younger sibling Charcoal (a Scottish Terrier) as either the scapegoat or for misdirection (messing up his bed, or mounting a raid on bins). She really liked a few things, food, warm soft places, sleep and people (in that order).

One thing that really aggravated her was being told to go. Unfortunately, now she even though we may wish for her to stay longer, she will continue on to a better place. At nearly 12 years of age, she has lived a relatively long life. May she dream sweet dreams and rest in peace.
