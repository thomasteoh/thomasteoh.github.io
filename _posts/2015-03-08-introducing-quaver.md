title: Introducing, Quaver
---

My dog, Quaver, is a cross between a miniature fox terrier and a Jack Russell terrier. A picture of him can be found [here](http://www.tteoh.com/public/2015-03-08-quaver.jpg)

He lives at home with us, and gets along for the most part with the cat, Crotchet. At the time of this post, he is approximately 5 years of age. He listens very well and is reasonably well behaved, but he also has a bit of a timid nature and is distrustful of strangers. 

## Strengths

- Chasing balls
- Assuming a submissive recumbent position
- Sleeping
