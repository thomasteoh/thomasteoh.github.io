In the suburb of Kew, in Melbourne, there is a store that is operated by one of the largest Australian atlantic salmon operations, [Tassal](http://www.tassal.com.au). They supply many of the salmon fillets, cutlets, and processed products (smoked, canned) that you see commonly in grocery stores and supermarkets. As they are farmed in Tasmania, consuming this fish is considered relatively environmentally conscientious.

Cuts of salmon aren't the cheapest fish you can purchase in Australia, usually ranging from AUD$20 upwards per kilogram. As we regularly have this fish, tt made sense to purchase a bulk amount, sold at a lower rate, to portion down and freeze.
