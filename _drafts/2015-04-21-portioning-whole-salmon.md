In Kew, Melbourne, there is a store that is operated by one of the largest Australian salmon operations, Tassal. Many of the salmon fillets, cutlets, and processed products (smoked, canned) that you see commonly in grocery stores are sourced from this company. As a **** fish, it is possible to catch and farm them sustainably, making choosing this fish over certain others an environmentally concientious***** choice.

It is, however, on the more expensive side of things, usually ranging from AUD$20 upwards per kilogram.
