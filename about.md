I'm a PhD student within the parasitology group at the Faculty of Veterinary and Agricultural Sciences, the [University of Melbourne, Australia](http://www.unimelb.edu.au). My field of study focuses on a zoonotic microorganism named *Rickettsia felis*, which causes flea-borne spotted fever in humans. It's pretty interesting stuff!

I have a dog named Quaver, who is great company and keeps life interesting, and I enjoy dabbling in technology. Below are a few ways of getting in touch with me.
